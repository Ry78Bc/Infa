Why did people start to worry about the environment?

In the 20s of last millennium, General Motors came up with the idea of adding Tetraethyl lead to gasoline to boost the compression ratio. 

This turned out to be a bad idea and led to the death of many factory workers. Soon the government began to worry about it. But Standard Oil has released a fake scientific research on the safety of lead.

At that time, there was no serious research on this topic yet and they were allowed to continue production. For the next 40 years, oil companies simply bought the loyalty of researchers and the government. 

However in 1965, Claire Patterson, a geologist who previously worked in the Manhattan project, discovered an abnormal concenrtation of lead in the atmosphere. It took him a half of his life to achieve a complete ban on the use of lead in fuel in 1995. He is the real father of the environmental movement. 

After that, many environmental standards were accepted that reduced pollution from cars and factories. And now Euro 7 is coming, which will most likely mean a complete ban for gasoline engines. And Electric cars are offered as the main alternative.

But this solution brings with it several difficult problems. 
1. Most of the energy is still produced in coal-fired power plants. 
2. Lithium from batteries is also toxic.

Today we have 2 methods of recycling accumulators: 
1. burn 
2. dissolve 
Sounds Eco-Friendly.

And it is simply impossible to recycle all batteries, because they are all different. So they have to be disassembled manually.

I really hope that the experience of 20s will not be repeated and humanity will be able to find a solution to all these problems.
